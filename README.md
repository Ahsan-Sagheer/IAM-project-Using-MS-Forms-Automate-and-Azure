### 2. Power Automate Workflow

A Power Automate flow processes the form responses and creates users in Azure AD. Key steps include:

1. Trigger the workflow when a new form response is submitted.
2. Retrieve form details and map them to Azure AD fields.
3. Create a new user in Azure AD with default configurations (e.g., disabled account, predefined password).
